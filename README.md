# Blokers

Blokers software was created in the course of learning network programming. The program is designed 
to perform penetration attacks on networks, servers and computers in the lan network. It is used to 
test security and check the possibility of attacking computers in networks. It cannot be used 
otherwise than for educational purposes. There is no guarantee. It is old software, it is not known 
if it will work on new windows, but its source code can be studied for learning.
